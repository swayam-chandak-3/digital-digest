It will work with any skill that works with Claude, and can be used with any local model even with wifi turned off.\n\nIt requires docker, and will read any skills that are placed inside of `~/.adronite/skills`\n\nI added some skill-specific setup instructions here: [https://codistry.ai/docs/skills-runtime](https://codistry.ai/docs/skills-runtime)\n\nIt is available on the VSCode Marketplace, or can be downloaded from [here](https://codistry.ai/install).\n\nI am very interested in this community's feedback on something like this. My goal with building this was to try to remove as many barriers to entry as possible, one of the biggest being the need to send code to 3rd parties in order to be effective.\n\nI wanted to build something that could be used in the workplace without fear of getting fired for violating data policies (for sending code to 3rd party servers without approval), but was also actually effective at coding tasks.\n\nHere is what it looks like in action:\n\n[https://vimeo.com/1139475604](https://vimeo.com/1139475604)\n\n[https://codistry.ai/](https://codistry.ai/)\n\n[https://codistry.ai/install](https://codistry.ai/install)\n\nLet me know what you think!",

      "selftext": "I built a coding agent for VSCode called [Codistry](https://codistry.ai) that is designed specifically to work effectively small language models.\n\nAs part of that, I re-implemented the full Anthropic Skills paradigm to work with any model. It will work with any skill that works with Claude, and can be used with any local model even with wifi turned off.\n\nIt requires docker, and will read any skills that are placed inside of `~/.adronite/skills`\n\nI added some skill-specific setup instructions here: [https://codistry.ai/docs/skills-runtime](https://codistry.ai/docs/skills-runtime)\n\nIt is available on the VSCode Marketplace, or can be downloaded from [here](https://codistry.ai/install).\n\nI am very interested in this community's feedback on something like this. My goal with building this was to try to remove as many barriers to entry as possible, one of the biggest being the need to send code to 3rd parties in order to be effective.\n\nI wanted to build something that could be used in the workplace without fear of getting fired for violating data policies (for sending code to 3rd party servers without approval), but was also actually effective at coding tasks.\n\nHere is what it looks like in action:\n\n[https://vimeo.com/1139475604](https://vimeo.com/1139475604)\n\n[https://codistry.ai/](https://codistry.ai/)\n\n[https://codistry.ai/install](https://codistry.ai/install)\n\nLet me know what you think!",

    "title": "[R] Seeking Advice: Stalling at 45-50% Accuracy on HMS Brain Activity (EEG Spectrogram) Cross-Subject Classification",
    "source": "reddit",
    "content": "I am working on the HMS Harmful Brain Activity Classification task. The goal is to classify 10-minute EEG segments into 6 categories: Seizure, GPD, LRDA, GRDA, LPD, and Other, based on spectrogram representations.\n\nThe core challenge I am tackling is Cross-Subject Generalization. While my models perform exceptionally well (85%+) when training and testing on the same patients, the performance drops significantly to a 65-70% plateau when evaluated on \"unseen\" patients (Subject-Wise Split). This suggests the model is over-relying on \"patient fingerprints\" (baseline EEG power, hardware artifacts, skull morphology) rather than universal medical pathology.\n\nData Setup:\n\n• Input: 4-channel spectrograms (LL, RL, LP, RP) converted to 3-channel RGB images using a JET colormap.\n\n• Normalization: Log-transformation followed by Spectral Z-score normalization (per frequency band).\n\n• Validation Strategy: StratifiedGroupKFold based on patient\\\\\\_id to ensure no patient leakage.\n\nApproaches Attempted &amp; Results:\n\n1. Prototypical Few-Shot Learning (FSL)\n\n• Concept: Instead of standard classification, I used a ProtoNet with a ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to learn a metric space where clusters of diseases are formed.\n\n• Why it was used: To force the model to learn the \"similarity\" of a seizure across different brains rather than a hard-coded mapping.\n\n• Result: Reached \\\\\\~68% accuracy. High ROC-AUC (&gt;0.82), but raw accuracy stayed low. It seems the \"prototypes\" (centroids) shift too much between different patients.\n\n2. Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) / Patient-Agnostic Training\n\n• Concept: Added an adversarial head with a Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL).

      "selftext": "I am working on the HMS Harmful Brain Activity Classification task. The goal is to classify 10-minute EEG segments into 6 categories: Seizure, GPD, LRDA, GRDA, LPD, and Other, based on spectrogram representations.\n\nThe core challenge I am tackling is Cross-Subject Generalization. While my models perform exceptionally well (85%+) when training and testing on the same patients, the performance drops significantly to a 65-70% plateau when evaluated on \"unseen\" patients (Subject-Wise Split). This suggests the model is over-relying on \"patient fingerprints\" (baseline EEG power, hardware artifacts, skull morphology) rather than universal medical pathology.\n\nData Setup:\n\n• Input: 4-channel spectrograms (LL, RL, LP, RP) converted to 3-channel RGB images using a JET colormap.\n\n• Normalization: Log-transformation followed by Spectral Z-score normalization (per frequency band).\n\n• Validation Strategy: StratifiedGroupKFold based on patient\\\\\\_id to ensure no patient leakage.\n\nApproaches Attempted &amp; Results:\n\n1. Prototypical Few-Shot Learning (FSL)\n\n• Concept: Instead of standard classification, I used a ProtoNet with a ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to learn a metric space where clusters of diseases are formed.\n\n• Why it was used: To force the model to learn the \"similarity\" of a seizure across different brains rather than a hard-coded mapping.\n\n• Result: Reached \\\\\\~68% accuracy. High ROC-AUC (&gt;0.82), but raw accuracy stayed low. It seems the \"prototypes\" (centroids) shift too much between different patients.\n\n2. Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) / Patient-Agnostic Training\n\n• Concept: Added an adversarial head with a Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL). The model has two tasks: 1) Classify the disease, and 2) Fail to identify the patient.\n\n• Why it was used: To mathematically \"scrub\" the patient-specific features from the latent space, forcing the backbone to become \"Model Agnostic.\"\n\n• Result: Improved generalization stability, but accuracy is still stuck in the high 60s. The adversarial head's accuracy is low (good sign), but the diagnostic head isn't pushing further.\n\n3.

I honestly never knew if I was making a smart financial move or just wasting $25 on grading fees.\n2. **The Scalper Wall:** Every time a new set drops, I’d try to buy a box at MSRP, only to get beaten by bots. These notification apps never have worked for me. I have never successfully bought a product online\n\nI’m a software engineer by trade, so I decided to stop guessing and start building. I spent the last few months coding a tool I call **Slab Advisor**.\n\nI built it to be a \"Sanctuary\" for collectors who want fairness and data, not hype. Here is what it does:\n\n* **\"Should I Grade?\" Analysis:** I built an AI model and data tracker that doesn't just look at the price—it helps you analyze if a card is *actually worth* sending in based on the current spread and condition. No more guessing. As you track your cards it will keep track of cards that may be worth grading and offers a pregrading tool to help build confidence before sending it in\n* **The \"Fair Play\" Vault:** This is big for me. I know how hard it is to get product at MSRP. I’m building a members-only vault where I sell sealed products for the price I get them (near MSRP). The goal isn't to flip; it's to create a fair distribution system that actively blocks bots so real collectors can actually open packs. I built a system  that will provide random offers to users when they log in, removing a storefront bots monitor. I will provide easter egg hunts with product hidden within the website that changes over time.\n* **Portfolio Logic:** It tracks your collection's value based on real-time market data, treating your collection like the asset class it is.\n* **Gamification:** This app is made to be social, share your collection with friends and earn badges and trophies as you collect cards.\n\nIt’s just me building this (no big team, no VC money).

I want to create a platform that allows developers to spin up a **dummy REST API in less than 30 seconds.**\n\nThe goal is to make it as frictionless as possible for anyone waiting on their backend team, testers who need specific data, or people teaching/learning frontend.\n\n**The core features I’m planning:**\n\n* **Custom Schema:** You define the JSON structure you need (not just generic data).\n* **Chaos Engineering:** You can simulate API errors (e.g., 500s) and network delays just by adding query parameters.\n* **Dynamic Data:** It returns fresh data every time you hit the endpoint.\n\nIs this something you would actually use? Or are you happy with existing tools/local mock servers?\n\nThanks in advance for the feedback!  \n\\-Dhruv Burada",

I want to create a platform that allows developers to spin up a **dummy REST API in less than 30 seconds.**\n\nThe goal is to make it as frictionless as possible for anyone waiting on their backend team, testers who need specific data, or people teaching/learning frontend.\n\n**The core features I’m planning:**\n\n* **Custom Schema:** You define the JSON structure you need (not just generic data).\n* **Chaos Engineering:** You can simulate API errors (e.g., 500s) and network delays just by adding query parameters.\n* **Dynamic Data:** It returns fresh data every time you hit the endpoint.\n\nIs this something you would actually use? Or are you happy with existing tools/local mock servers?\n\nThanks in advance for the feedback!  \n\\-Dhruv Burada",

    "content": "A few months ago I was flying my DJI in a semi-rural area doing some mapping and testing, and everything was going fine… until I lost signal for a few seconds and it landed itself in tall grass near a ditch. It wasn’t “crashed,” but it might as well have been. I could see it on the camera feed, maybe 30 feet away, and there was absolutely nothing I could do. It couldn’t roll, it couldn’t crawl, it couldn’t recover. I had to walk out there and fish it out by hand, and the whole time I was thinking: why is this thing completely useless the moment it touches the ground?\n\nThat moment stuck with me. DJI makes great flying cameras, but they’re basically helpless outside of perfect conditions. If there’s rough terrain, obstacles, low visibility, or you can’t safely walk to it, you’re just out of luck. That frustration slowly turned into a side project where I tried to build something that wouldn’t immediately become dead weight the second it landed somewhere messy.\n\nSo I started working on a dual-mode platform that can both fly and drive, and more importantly, recover itself. The goal wasn’t “cool factor,” it was reliability. If it lands in grass, mud, rubble, or uneven terrain, it should be able to move, reposition, and take off again without needing a human rescue mission. At the same time, I wanted it to be modular, so it could carry different payloads depending on the mission instead of being locked into one camera setup forever.\n\nSo far, we’ve built it out with thermal imaging for low-visibility and night use, high-resolution RGB cameras for navigation and inspection, LiDAR for depth and obstacle mapping, optical flow sensors for low-altitude stability and near-ground positioning, and a swappable payload bay that lets us experiment with different sensor packages and hardware without redesigning the whole platform each time.\n\nAfter breaking plenty of parts along the way I now have a functioning base version, that I'm proud in, but seeing it actually crawl out of bad landings and relaunch for the first time was one of those “okay, this might actually work” moments.\n\nThis started purely out of frustration, but it’s turned into something I’m genuinely excited to keep improving. I’m mostly posting here to share the story and get feedback from other builders who’ve turned annoyance into projects.\n\nIf anyone’s curious, here’s the project page:  \n[Mercurius Technologies](https://mercuriustech.com/mercury/)\n\nWould love thoughts, criticism, or stories from anyone who’s had a similar “this tool just failed me” moment that pushed them to build something better.",

That's what prompted me to make [Cartara](https://cartara.ai/).\n\nAll you have to do is tag the files you want Cartara to track. Whenever those files change, it automatically creates or updates your documentation for you. It runs in your CI/CD pipeline, or you can refresh everything from the dashboard in the UI.\n\nLet me know what you all think!",

I’m a hobby nail artist who’s been doing gel nails since 2022, and I kept losing track of my designs, products, materials, and techniques to achieve a certain look or to maintain nail health.\n\nTo solve my own problem, I built a small app that helps me:  \n\n• Log my gel polishes and nail art supplies  \n\n• Attach photos + step‑by‑step notes for each set I have done.\n\nFeatures: \n\n• Picture Library with recipe inside, with CRUD, filters and tags  \n\n• Material Library, keep track of your products\n\n• Share Nail recipe to friends by PDF with images attached to them\n\n• Import/Export you entire nail recipe app history \n\n• Cute themes \n\nSo far so good, but it’s mostly catered to my issues I come across as a nail hobbyist. But it’s a good note taking app specifically catered towards nails!\n\nI would appreciate any questions, feedback or if interested in testing let me know im trying to figure it out as my first app. ",
