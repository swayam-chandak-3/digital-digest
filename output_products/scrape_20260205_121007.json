    "description": "Rob Hallam saw a pattern in his agency's leadgen, then partnered up and built a tool to leverage it. Now, his tool is at $23k MRR. Here's how.",
    "content": "Company\nSuperX\nFounder\nRob Hallam\nRevenue\n$23K a month\nRob Hallam got laid off and spent 2.5 years failing to grow five products. After launching a dev agency to keep the lights on, he realized that all of his clients came from his viral posts on X, so he reverse engineered those posts.\nFrom there, he partnered with Tibo and built\nSuperX\n. And six months later, it's at $23k MRR.\nHere's Rob on how he did it.\n👇\nFive failures\nI'm Rob. I'm building\nSuperX\n, the only platform that helps you grow faster on X — the right way.\nI took the traditional path for most of my life. Worked hard at school, went to university, got a computer science degree, software engineering job, yada yada. Then, my first employer laid me off, which wasn't unwelcome at that stage, and I decided I was done with the corporate world.\nI spent the next two and a half years trying to build something online. Five products, five attempts — earning me a total of $0. Every single one flopped. But I kept posting on X about what I was working on, sharing the failures along with any small wins.\nThen one\npost\nblew up. I shared everything that had gone wrong, and it got 200,000 views. Someone in the comments suggested I start a dev agency. I announced it the next day, landed a $3,000 client from that same post, and suddenly had inbound work coming through X constantly.\nThat's when I realized the content was the distribution. I started building tools to systemize how I found and created viral posts. That became\nSuperX\n.\nWe launched in July 2025 and hit $1k MRR on day one. Now, we're at $23K MRR with around 650 paying customers at $39/mo, growing around 20-25% month over month, and I run it while traveling the world.\nDesperation and pattern recognition\nThis all came from desperation and pattern recognition.\nAfter those five failures, I was starting to get seriously anxious about money. Living in financial scarcity messes with your head in ways that are hard to explain until you've been there.\nThe dev agency changed that. But it also revealed something: Every single client was coming inbound through X. Every time a post did well, my DMs filled up. The problem was I couldn't make it happen on demand. Some posts would blow up, others would flop, and I had no idea why.\nSo I started building tools to figure it out. I wanted to reverse-engineer what was working: Find viral posts in my niche, understand the patterns, and create my own versions. Then, I partnered with my now-cofounder, Tibo.\nPartnering up and rebuilding\nWhile I was building those internal tools, I connected with Tibo. He'd acquired a Chrome extension called SuperX from another maker. It helped people find viral tweets, which was exactly what I'd been trying to solve for myself. He already had an audience in the X growth space, but he was juggling multiple products and needed someone to build it out properly who shared the same vision, so we decided to partner up. My task was to turn the extension into a full-fledged web app.\nThat was the plan anyway. In practice, I rebuilt everything from the ground up. The Chrome extension, the analytics infrastructure, how we embed and search tweets, authentication, syncing between the web app and extension, even migrating payment processors from Lemon Squeezy to Stripe.\nIt's the most complex project I've ever worked on. The first seven months before launch were brutal. I got hospitalized twice while traveling, first with food poisoning in Guatemala, then stress-induced neck spasms in Colombia. X kept changing their API and breaking things. I'd wake up to dozens of messages saying\nSuperX\nwas down. But I kept building and kept posting about it, which was probably the only reason we had an audience ready when we finally launched.\nThe SuperX tech stack\nHere's our stack.\nFor development:\nNext.js\nNode.js\nTailwind\nSQLite\nX API is our biggest cost at around $2-3K/month.\nClaude Code for AI-assisted development\nFor AI:\nOpenAI\nAnthropic's Claude API\nFor the business side:\nStripe for payments\nPostHog for analytics\nFramer for the landing page\nScreen Studio for the demo videos that tend to do well on X\nOrganic growth\nGrowth has been almost entirely organic. On launch day, we added $1K MRR in 24 hours. From there, it's been about going viral over and over again. Every time a post blows up, we get a wave of signups. The content is the growth engine.\nThe strategy is simple: post with intention, not randomly. I follow a loop:\nStart with something entertaining or vulnerable to get attention.\nFollow up with something educational or a product demo while people are watching.\nThen post the results, the screenshot of signups or revenue, and make it inspirational.\nRepeat.\nPeople see my content on X, sign up for a 7-day free trial, and about 30% convert to paid.\nThe key is systemizing it. I use\nSuperX\nto find what's going viral in my niche, break down why it worked, and create my own version. I'm not guessing what to post anymore. I'm finding proven concepts and adding my personality.\nVideo has been huge. When I switched from text posts to video, I got around 10x the reach. X is pushing video hard right now (going the TikTok route), so I leaned into that. The dancing demos, my lifestyle vlogs, and the screen recordings with my face in the corner consistently outperform everything else.\nThe other thing is building real connections. Not spamming replies with \"great post!\" but actually engaging with people in my niche. A lot of my early users came from relationships I built just by being genuinely interested in what other people were working on.\nWe've spent maybe $5K total on ads, but 95% of our users have come from organic content.\nDistribution from day one\nIf I had to start over, I'd focus on distribution from day one. My first five products failed because nobody knew they existed.\nWith\nSuperX\n, I built the audience and the product at the same time. I set myself a goal when I started: Post a video every day until I hit $10K MRR. It sounds simple, but most people don't do it. They post when they feel like it, get discouraged when something flops, and disappear for a week. The algorithm (and the Internet) forgets you fast.\nConsistency compounds. I went from 900 followers to 40K by showing up every day. Some posts do nothing. Some blow up. But you only get the big ones if you keep showing up.\nKeep going when it gets tough\nRunning a business while traveling sounds glamorous, but\ngetting hospitalized twice\nwhile your product is breaking is not fun. There were points where I genuinely considered quitting.\nWhat kept me going was posting about it. Sounds weird, but sharing the struggles publicly meant thousands of people holding me accountable. I couldn't quit because I'd told everyone I wouldn't.\nBuild for freedom\nDo things with intention, not emotion.\nFigure out what you're actually optimizing for. For most indie hackers, it's freedom. And freedom comes from money. So optimize for money from the start.\nThat means validating early. Ask people to pay before you build the thing. It feels uncomfortable, but you can always refund them if it doesn't work out. What you can't get back is the months you spent building something nobody wanted.\nWhat's next?\nUp next: $100K MRR. Sooner rather than later.\nBeyond that, I want to keep creating. Not just\nSuperX\n. I want to grow my YouTube channel, make more vlogs, maybe build something in real life. I love being behind the camera and in the video editor.\nA good friend of mine and legendary indie hacker, Tony Dinh, told me he sees life in three buckets: create, learn, and love. My goals for the future are to optimize for all three. Money is the lubricant, which is why the $100K target comes first.\nYou can follow along on\nX\n,\nYouTube\n, and\nInstagram\n. And check out\nSuperX\n!",

    "description": "Amos Bar-Joseph is building an autonomous company with the goal of hitting $10M/yr per employee. Here's how.",
    "content": "Company\nSwan AI\nFounder\nAmos Bar-Joseph\nRevenue\n<$83K a month\nAmos Bar-Joseph has two exits under his belt, but he says he didn't do them right. This time, he's determined to build differently.\nHe and his two founders set out to build an autonomous company that brings in $10M per employee. And after roughly a year,\nSwan AI\nis nearly at $1M ARR with three cofounders.\nHere's Amos on how he's doing it.\n👇\nThe problem with venture capital\nI built and scaled two startups the traditional way — raised venture capital, grew fast, landed two acquisitions. From the outside, it looked like success. From the inside, it felt sick.\nHere's what \"the playbook\" actually looked like:\nRaise $2M-5M before you've found product-market fit.\nScale to 40+ employees before you hit your first million in revenue.\nBurn through runway while rolling the bluff from one funding round to the next, hoping you figure out the business model before the music stops.\nI did this twice. Both times, it worked — we got acquired. But both times, I knew we'd built on a shaky foundation, grinding through years of manufactured growth trajectories to satisfy investor timelines, rather than building something genuinely sustainable.\nNow, I'm working on\nSwan AI\n. It's my attempt at completely reinventing how you scale a company from zero to hyper-growth.\nIt's Lovable for GTM. It's an AI GTM Engineer that helps sales, marketing, and founders turn any GTM process into an agentic workflow in seconds, from prompt to pipeline.\nIn 2025, we grew from 0-200 customers closing in on a 7-figure ARR with just 3 FTEs (the co-founders).\nTargeting $10M ARR per employee\nFor a long time, staying lean meant staying small. That was the tradeoff. But AI agents finally make it possible to build an \"autonomous business.\"\nI started Swan because I'd seen enough of the old way to know it was dying, and I wanted to prove the new way could win.\nWe're not trying to be a lean, $5M ARR lifestyle business. We're targeting $10M ARR per employee with an ultra-small team, proving you can hit the same scale as traditional unicorns but without the bloat, bureaucracy, and burnout.\nThat's not a vanity metric, by the way — it's the constraint that shapes every decision we make. If a problem can't be solved with AI or systems, we question whether we should solve it at all.\nInstead of the old playbook we're building a new one: Stay lean, use AI to amplify each person, and scale through intelligence rather than headcount. We're documenting everything publicly because if this works, it changes the entire game.\nBuilding the wrong thing\nWe built the wrong thing first. Like everyone else in the space, we started with an AI SDR - automated prospecting, personalized emails, the usual playbook.\nThe workflow was simple: find prospects, filter with AI, personalize outreach, send sequences. It was clean on a whiteboard and easy to build.\nThen, a customer asked us something that broke everything: \"Can you make it work for webinar attendees instead of cold leads?\"\nOur beautiful workflow? Useless. We'd built automation pretending to be intelligence. Every new use case meant rebuilding from scratch.\nThat's when we realized we weren't building what we actually needed. We were running Swan's entire GTM ourselves — three founders, no SDRs, no marketing team. We were the use case. And we needed something that could adapt as fast as our strategy changed.\nSo, we scrapped the rigid workflows and rebuilt around a different idea: AI that could reason about\nany\nGTM motion, not just execute pre-defined steps.\nThe rebuild took weeks, not months. When you're three people with no buffer, you don't have the luxury of long cycles. We shipped fast, used it ourselves, and let our own pain guide every iteration.\nUse constraints to force innovation\nConstraints force innovation that comfort never would. And we had a big constraint: No hiring, period.\nA great example is how our support ops evolved over time.\nWhen support tickets hit 200/week, most startups would hire two support reps. We built a self-learning AI agent instead — and learned more about human-AI collaboration in four weeks than we would have in a year of \"normal\" scaling.\nHere's how it evolved:\nWeek 1:\nWe gave our AI agent 20 documented answers and let it loose in Slack. It handled maybe 15% of tickets. Everything else still came to us.\nWeek 2:\nInstead of trying to document every possible question, we built an escalation loop. When the AI didn't know something, it stayed in the customer's thread but pinged us internally. We'd provide the answer, the AI would deliver it. The customer never knew we were behind the scenes.\nWeek 4:\nWe noticed we were answering the same new questions repeatedly. So we added one feature: after we answered an escalated question, the AI automatically documented it for future use.\nThat simple loop changed everything. Within two weeks, we went from 15% to 70% autonomous resolution. The knowledge base grew from 20 to 180 solutions — not because we wrote documentation, but because the system learned from every human interaction.\nThe constraint of not hiring forced us to build something smarter than we would have if we'd just added headcount.\nAnd it taught us something important: Don't try to make AI perfect before you ship it. Make it good enough to start, then build the feedback loops that let humans teach it as you go.\nBreaking the model\nThe autonomous business model almost broke at 50 customers.\nWe'd built Swan to prove three founders could scale without hiring. And for the first six weeks, it worked beautifully — our AI agents handled support, onboarding, and pipeline generation while we focused on closing deals.\nThen we hit the wall: 267 demo calls per week. Two founders were completely maxed out. 20% close rate meant we needed every one of those calls, but we physically couldn't do more.\nThe math was brutal. We'd proven that AI could handle 70% of customer interactions autonomously. But sales conversations — the highest-leverage moments — were still 100% human. And humans don't scale.\nWe had two options: Hire salespeople (breaking our model) or fundamentally change how we sold.\nWe chose the harder path. In seven days, we killed our entire sales-led motion and rebuilt around product-led growth. Self-serve for qualified leads. No demo required to get started.\nIt was the riskiest bet we'd made — our whole thesis depended on it working.\nIf I did it again, I'd build for self-serve from day one. We thought we needed high-touch sales to learn, but we actually learned more from watching people use the product without us hovering. The demo bottleneck forced a better model. I just wish we'd gotten there faster.\nAn AI-native stack\nOur stack is built around one principle: AI-native from the ground up, not AI bolted onto legacy tools.\nEngineering:\nCursor - AI copilot that lets our CTO ship what used to require a 15-person team\nV0 by Vercel - Turns product concepts into working prototypes in hours\nBaz - AI code review that catches what humans miss\nGTM & Sales:\nSwan AI\n- Our own product, turning anonymous traffic into a qualified pipeline\nShortwave - AI email agent managing hundreds of conversations with perfect follow-up timing\nUnipile - LinkedIn automation API\nData & Intelligence:\nExplorium - B2B data foundation purpose-built for AI agents\nSonar by Perplexity - Agentic web research that never stops\nAttio - CRM that's programmable, not just a database\nAgent Building:\nn8n - Low-code platform for internal automations\nRetool Agents - AI agents on top of internal apps without engineering overhead\nBase44 - Builds interactive tools and websites through AI\nThe pattern: Every tool is either AI-native or built for programmatic automation. Nothing that requires a human to babysit it.\nGrowth via organic content\nWe grew Swan almost entirely through organic LinkedIn posts. No paid ads. No marketing hire. No PR agency.\nWe got 6M+ impressions in our first year and hit 200+ customers. All through, organic content being posted by the founders consistently.\nLinkedIn became our entire top-of-funnel. Every deal we closed in the first six months started with someone seeing a post, visiting the site, or DMing me directly. The content didn't just build awareness — it built trust before the first conversation. And trust means higher conversion, lower churn, and customers who actually fit.\nAn AI-assisted content engine\nHere's the system behind it:\nI built what I call an AI content engine using Claude Projects. It's not about using AI to write faster. It's about using AI to think better.\nThe setup:\nA Claude Project loaded with my content pillars (the thematic angles I use to interpret any topic), brand guidelines, and examples of my best-performing posts. The system prompt tells Claude how to collaborate with me — run a creative process before responding, always give three options, wait for my input between phases.\nThe workflow:\nI come with a raw idea or insight. Claude helps me find the right angle, suggests hooks, and pressure-tests the structure. We iterate through strategy → narrative arc → execution. I never publish something Claude wrote alone. I publish something we developed together that sounds like me.\nThe result:\nA flywheel of content → trust → inbound → self-serve → happy customers → case studies → more content. Slow to spin up, but it compounds. This model is the moat.\nThe philosophy that makes it work:\nAI karma is real. If you're using AI to manufacture content without having anything original to say, it shows. The audience feels it. But if you're using AI to amplify genuine insights you've earned — through building, failing, learning — the content compounds.\nI call this agent \"Shakespeare.\" It runs my entire content engine now. But every post starts with something I actually believe. That's non-negotiable.\nA skill vs a product category\nThe best advice I can give is this: Stop thinking about AI as a product category and start thinking about it as a skill you develop.\nMost founders are waiting. Waiting for the right AI tool, the perfect use case, or someone to tell them where to start. Meanwhile, a small group is building. They're shipping ugly automations, breaking things, and learning what actually works. They're developing AI muscle.\nHere's what that means practically: Get fluent with systems thinking. Learn to break processes into steps. Understand how tools connect through APIs and webhooks. Mess around with Make, n8n, or Retool. You don't need to understand LLMs — you need to understand workflows.\nThen, pick something small and automate it. Lead enrichment. Meeting prep. Support triage. Doesn't matter what. Build a version that's 60% as good as doing it manually. Watch where it breaks. Fix it. Repeat.\nThe insight that changed everything for us was that AI agents don't need perfect instructions. They need feedback loops. Build systems where the AI can learn from corrections, and it gets smarter every week.\nThe founders who build this muscle now will have a compounding advantage. The ones who wait for AI to \"mature\" will spend the next five years buying tools from the people who didn't wait.\nStart before you're ready. That's always the advice, but it's never been truer than with AI.\nWhat's next?\nOur goal isn't just to build a successful company. It's to prove a new model works — so others can follow.\nThe autonomous business thesis is simple: Humans with AI leverage can achieve outcomes that used to require massive headcount. But right now, it's still a thesis. There are early signals — Cursor, Bolt, Lovable hitting incredible revenue-per-employee numbers — but no one's documented the full playbook from zero to scale.\nThat's what we're trying to do with Swan.\nThis isn't about staying small forever. It's about proving that when you optimize for human-AI collaboration, every person on the team becomes a force multiplier. Maybe we stay at three founders. Maybe we eventually grow to ten people doing the work of a hundred. The point is the leverage, not the headcount.\nNo massive funding rounds before you've found product-market fit. No 50-person team to brute-force growth. No burning years of your life managing complexity instead of creating value.\nIf we pull this off, the playbook becomes real. Every framework we build, every system we create, every mistake we make — we're sharing it publicly so founders who come after us don't have to figure it out alone.\nFollow the journey:\nswan-ai.beehiiv.com\n‚ my newsletter documenting how we're building an autonomous business.

    "description": "Rox Codes built a tool, partnered with the right creator, rebuilt it, and used the partnership to gain exposure. Here's how.",
    "content": "Company\nFlightcast\nFounder\nRox Codes\nRevenue\n…\nRox Codes tried and failed until he had his first 5-figure MRR success and exited. Then, he partnered with the right person and built the tool that he hopes will become his magnum opus:\nFlightcast\n.\nHe launched five months ago and revenue has already surpassed his first success. Here's Rox on how he did it.\n👇\nFailures and successes\nI've been building tools for creators for over five years.\nI studied CS in college, then tried to do restaurant startups. I failed.\nSo, I sold everything and moved to Thailand and became a digital nomad for a few years.\nDuring that time, I became a full-time Twitch streamer, live coding eight hours a day. I built tools for Twitch streamers. That failed too.\nThen, I started building\nThumbnailTest.com\nfor YouTubers. The MrBeast team found me and I worked there for a bit, building tools for them.\nAfter I left Beast, I sold ThumbnailTest while it was at a 5-figure MRR. That was in early 2024, four months before YouTube released their competitor.\nSoon after that, Steven Bartlett from The Diary of a CEO reached out and said \"Let's build something together.\" We messed around with ideas for a few months before we came up with\nFlightcast\n— video-first podcast hosting.\nWe officially launched in October 2025. We use a flat SaaS subscription plus a small cut of ads. Already, revenue is higher than it ever was for ThumbnailTest.\nDead simple but awesome\nI love building for creators. After years in the space, I know enough that I can finally tell when there's something missing.\nThere are a lot of \"tools for creators\", but very few doing different things. Just lots of AI. I wanted to build a business that felt simple — explicitly not using AI at the core, but just in a feature or two.\nI chose video podcasting because it's a super annoying problem — big files, uploaded many times, analytics scattered across many platforms. It felt like a fun space to try to build something.\nIf I do this right,\nFlightcast\nshould feel dead simple but awesome.\nLots of iterations\nIt's built on NextJS, Cloudflare, Go backend for some media stuff, and OVH for servers. And we finally moved to Planetscale for the DB, thank God.\nBuilding it took a lot of iterations. It's surprisingly awkward to mix a lot of these APIs. And I had to redo the data architecture a bunch of times too.\nLetting people do five posts at once sounds great, but man it sucks to build.\nIf I did it again, I'd limit v1.0 to just one awesome feature — likely analytics — and ship that before taking on the additional complexity of publishing, etc. And even if I kept an expanded feature set for v1.0, I would finish one at a time instead of building several things at once.\nOnce that was done, we started bringing on beta users and building against feedback.\nThe rule was - we can't launch until it's good enough for The Diary of a CEO.\nBeing a CEO\nI'm CEO this time, which is really unusual for me. I can't just be an engineer anymore.\nIt's harder to lock in when you can't just go into code for 12 hours. And I've had to learn to feel good about my work even when it isn't as tangible or straightforward.\nThen there's managing a team. We got seed funding for the first time in my life, so we brought in a couple of people smarter than me.\nI'm used to working by myself. I had no idea how to run a team or build a product from scratch with others. And it was especially difficult because I was the one with most of the context, but half of building is learning what works.\nHonestly, if I had to start over, I probably would have delayed bringing on a team until the foundation was done.\nI'm so proud I get to have this moment in my journey at all, but damn it's tough.\nPrefilled distribution\nAfter fighting distribution for a long time, I came to understand the creator world, and I realized that I needed a partner with the right audience and mindset. With this business, partnering with Steve essentially prefilled the distribution.\nSo here's some advice: Partner with a creator. If you find the right one, it'll be the best decision you ever make.\nWe had probably the largest launch of my entire life on LinkedIn + PR in podcast news outlets.\nThe entire expanded Flight team posted on LinkedIn on the same day — their entire network is podcast people. We had millions of impressions and hundreds of paying customers by the end of it. It was a multi-year \"overnight success\" kind of day.\nSince then, growth has been pretty straightforward. Lots of podcasts recommending\nFlightcast\nto friends. And agencies adding more and more shows.\nBut we have some upcoming big marketing strategies. I'll be on podcasts, we're launching an affiliate program, and we'll be giving podcasters discounts for putting\nFlightcast\nads into their shows.\nTalk to people more successful than you\nWhat helped me most was talking to people who are a good bit more successful than me about very specific problems: people problems, hiring problems, mindset problems, running a tech team, etc.\nThere's a lot written about everything to do with indie hacking, but less so when things get bigger. Or at least - the writing about it is more generic. It's harder to learn from.\nGetting coffee with a friend who runs a company 1-2 stages beyond mine has been a blessing again and again.\nCare more than anyone else\nHere's where to start:\nFind a bunch of people who make decent money, but not enough people pay attention to.\nFind what they're using right now.\nReplace one thing — make your entire first build just one amazing feature.\nI took ThumbnailTest straight out of TubeBuddy, and over many months made my A/B tester 5x better. I made it an easy, obvious choice for anyone using TubeBuddy to switch to ThumbnailTest.\nYou can do the same. Just care way more about one small problem than anyone else has.\nWhat are your goals for the future?\nI want\nFlightcast\nto be my magnum opus.\nI want to build something so good it redefines the expectations people have for what a tool like this can do.\nYou can follow along on\nX\nor\nmy website\n. Listen to this\npodcast\n. And check out\nFlightcast\n!",

    "description": "Einar Vollset \"fell into\" M&A after he sold his first business. Now, his investment bank has a yearly deal flow of $100M+. Here's how.",
    "content": "Companies\nDiscretion Capital, TinySeed\nFounder\nEinar Vollset\nRevenue\n…\nEinar Vollset was an academic with a PhD in Computer Science. Then, he started a YC-backed company, exited, exited again, and \"fell into\" the M&A space. Now, he's the cofounder of\nTinySeed\nand founding partner of\nDiscretion Capital\n, which does $100M+ in deal volume.\nHere's Einar on how he got here.\n👇\nFalling into it\nI have a PhD in Computer Science and I was a professor at Cornell for a couple of years. Then, I sort of just fell into this lifestyle, honestly.\nI sold my second business in 2015-16 and then got pulled into doing technical due diligence work for old-school PE firms. One time, I was out to dinner with one of those clients, and someone said, \"You know we pay for deal flow.\" I had no idea what that meant, so he explained, \"You know, if you introduce us to someone we end up buying, we'll give you a cut.\" I now realize this is what buy-side brokers do.\nSo, I did that a couple of times, and one ended up closing.\nRight around then, the larger PE firms started moving down market in the B2B SaaS space — before 2010 or so it was rare for PE to buy SaaS businesses with less than $10M ARR, but they started buying as low as $1M. So, lots of founders that I knew (directly or indirectly) started getting cold inbound offers from PE to sell their business, and I ended up being the go-to guy for advice.\nInitially, I'd just give founders my opinion — good offer, crap offer, terrible firm, etc. Then, one time I was chatting with someone and I explained that not only was the offer likely 1-2x lower than what he could get, the PE firm that had made the was notorious for firing all domestic staff and milking profits. He then said, \"Okay, thanks. Hey, could you help me find a better offer?\"\nSo I thought, \"Yeah, I probably could.\" And here we are.\nDiscretion and TinySeed\nThese days, I'm mostly working on:\nDiscretion Capital\n— a bootstrapped investment bank\nTinySeed\n— a fund for mostly bootstrapped founders\nWhen getting started on\nDiscretion\n, I didn't want to hire a bunch of MBAs, and I couldn't afford PitchBook or other databases of deals and portfolios. So, I built a set of scrapers to keep track of approximately all the PE firms in the world and their portfolios.\nOur internal systems are quite a bit more sophisticated now, with AI and things, but the core idea remains: We keep track of who owns what, when they bought it, etc.\nBigger deals\nDiscretion\ncharges a success fee — a percent of the transaction price. That makes revenue highly variable.\nAnd we grow our revenue by serving more and larger clients. We started out focusing on companies with $1-10M ARR. Now, we say we do $2-20M ARR, but we'll probably have to bump up that top number a bit this year.\nClient growth has been via word of mouth. Once you add 300% to someone's initial offer, word gets out.\nThe last few years, we've done well above $100M in transaction volume yearly.\nEducating the market\nThe biggest challenge is educating founders — particularly technical founders, which make up about 95% of our clients. They're often pretty suspicious of \"investment bankers\" — or \"investment wankers\" as one English client memorably referred to us initially.\nThey often feel like, \"Hey, this is something I could just do myself and save the fee.\" Which is true. They can do it themselves and save the fee. But the problem is that with the market being so opaque and sellers (usually) only ever selling a business once, it's extremely hard to get top dollar if you DIY.\nIt doesn't feel fair, but that's just the truth.\nA technical advantage\nBeing very technical and not your usual \"investment wanker\" has been a huge plus for us.\nOften, the junior guys tasked with actually doing the work for the kinds of banks we compete with — at least on the upper end of our ARR range — are not very technical and quite often a bit resentful they've been put on such a \"small\" deal.\nDon't be anti-sales\nMy advice is simple: Don't be anti-sales. And don't be anti-selling-to-enterprises.\nIt's an incredibly valuable thing to ask yourself, \"What can I build that someone would pay $500 (or $5000) a month for?\"\nWhat's next?\nMy goal for the future is to flyfish more.\nYou can check out\ndiscretioncapital.com\n, email me at\n[email protected]\n, or watch me argue for fun as\n@einarvollset\non the Twitters.",

    "title": "Building an app portfolio to $60k/mo after Apple froze his developer account",
    "description": "Viktor Seraleev built a mobile portfolio and got shut down by Apple. Then, he rebuilt it — now it's bringing in $60k/mo. Here's how.",
    "content": "Company\nSarafan Mobile\nFounder\nViktor Seraleev\nRevenue\n>$60K a month\nViktor Seraleev started over three times — and the third time took a toll. But now, his\nportfolio of apps\nis thriving once again with an MRR of $60k.\nHere's Viktor on what went wrong and how he fixed it.\n👇\nLaunching, selling, and rebuilding\nI didn’t know what I wanted to do after university. But one thing was clear: I didn’t want to work a traditional 9–to-5 job. And that left me with no option but to become an entrepreneur.\nI started with offline businesses, but over time, I gradually shifted my focus to online products and digital businesses where I could build, iterate, and scale on my own terms.\nNow, I’m an indie mobile app developer and founder. I’ve been building and shipping iOS and Android apps since 2020, mostly in the photo/video, creative tool, and utility spaces. Over the years, I’ve launched 30+ apps, sold several of them, and rebuilt my business multiple times from zero.\nI currently run a profitable\nportfolio\nthat has been growing consistently for the last 2 years. In December 2025, I finished the month with $60.1k+ in proceeds — after Apple’s commission.\nStarting from scratch\nI had to start from scratch three times.\nThe first time was in 2020, when I left my partners and decided to go solo.\nThe second time was because I couldn’t build anything meaningful. I had money in the bank and saw it as the perfect moment to fully reset and rethink.\nThe third was one of the hardest times of my life, personally and professionally.\nIt was 2022. I had to relocate from Russia to Chile and overnight, my business became fully international. Before February 2022, about 75% of my revenue came from Russia. And that went down to nearly zero. That alone was a challenge, but just as I started to recover, I encountered a true black swan event.\nApple terminated my developer account. I spent eight months trying to understand why. Eventually, I discovered that after we parted ways, my former partners had registered a company with the same name. Apple shut down their account, and the connection caused my entire business to collapse as well. I took Apple to court, but the judge ruled account termination is part of standard contractual relationships and entirely Apple’s decision.\nAt the same time, sanctions caused my main bank to close the company account and freeze the funds. I had nothing — in a new country, with no access to my own money.\nIt was one of the most stressful and painful periods of my life. Climbing out of that hole took a huge emotional and mental toll. But it also shaped how I think today. I’m not chasing chaos or constant restarts anymore. Now, I value stability, predictability, and transparency most. I work fully in the open, build sustainable businesses in public, and focus on long-term resilience rather than short-term wins.\nA $400k exit\nMy first solo product stemmed from a practical need.\nIn 2020, my wife and I ran a family business — a manicure salon. One evening, she tried to create a simple Instagram video: a before-and-after manicure using a slider effect. Surprisingly, she couldn’t find an app on the App Store for this purpose. I didn't believe it at first and searched for it myself. I found nothing.\nSo, I designed a simple UI and a friend helped me build the first version of the app. It was buggy and imperfect, but after a complete redesign and several updates, the app grew fast.\nIn just eight months, net proceeds grew from $200 to $34,000. Eventually, I sold the app for $410,000 – without actively seeking a buyer. Someone offered to buy it, and I accepted.\nSet a personal challenge\nLaunching a personal challenge was one of my most helpful decisions. I set myself a goal: build 10 apps by the end of the year. And that challenge forced me to adopt a strategy of small bets and fast iterations.\nThe rules were simple:\nProjects had to be high quality.\nThey had to be small but genuinely useful.\nThe challenge had to be completed, no matter what.\nAfter finishing, you don't just gain valuable assets. More importantly, you gain real clarity. You'll learn:\nWhich projects are worth scaling\nWhich ones to shut down or sell\nWhere to actually invest your time and energy\nNative vs cross-platform development\nMy tech stack choice is obvious. For video-related apps, native development works best, so I use Swift. And I have my own in-house video rendering technology.\nThat said, I also experiment. Last year I shipped two apps: one built with Kotlin Multiplatform and another with React Native. I was pleasantly surprised by how much cross-platform development has improved over the years.\nIf you’re not working heavily with video, cross-platform development is absolutely the right choice\nMobile subscriptions vs ads\nAll my apps use a subscription model.\nThe apps are free to download, but users pay for premium features. I usually offer two plans: a weekly and a yearly subscription. During major global sales (like Black Friday or end-of-year campaigns), I run limited discounts, which typically increase daily revenue by 30–40%.\nI also deliberately decided to avoid ads in my apps entirely. I don’t like the advertising model as a user, so I choose not to use it in my products. I stick to this principle: I build clean, focused apps where revenue comes directly from delivering value to users.\nSecret sauce for mobile growth\nHere’s my “secret sauce” for consistently attracting users and growing mobile apps. Nothing magical — just channels proven reliable over time.\nASO (App Store Optimization):\nOne of the most stable acquisition channels. App Store search generates around 25% of traffic. The basics matter most: a strong title, subtitle, and carefully selected keywords. Visibility on competitors’ app pages generates another ~10%.\nInitial boost at launch:\nI often use a simple formula of keyword + unique app name. Check how your app name appears in search before release.\nThis method doesn’t always work, but the last time it generated 34 trials right after launch.\nPersonal blog and social media:\nI regularly share posts about my apps and my journey. One post alone reached 600k+ views on Twitter. This channel has been surprisingly consistent for me.\nGoogle Ads:\nI tested multiple paid channels and eventually focused on Google Ads. Others were either too expensive or not profitable enough at scale.\nTikTok and Instagram Reels:\nI wanted to personally create video content about my apps. Last year, I spent a month posting six videos per day (three in Spanish, three in English). Dozens of videos crossed 100k views, several reached 500k+, and one passed 1.2M views. It works, but it’s very time-consuming and consistency is hard to maintain.\nApple Search Ads:\nBefore my developer account was terminated, this was my main acquisition channel. It’s currently on pause — in the photo/video niche, competition has driven prices very high.\nProduct Hunt:\nI occasionally launch apps on Product Hunt. It provides early feedback from a loyal audience and some initial traffic. A good launch requires preparation.\nDon't go it alone\nOne thing that helped me a lot came from earlier in life.\nGrowing up, my parents always taught me one simple rule: Never give up. Stay strong, even when things are hard.\nThis mindset helped me psychologically survive the most difficult moments and rebuild my business from zero — multiple times.\nI’m also not doing this alone. My family — my wife and our children — are always by my side. Their support matters more than anything else, especially during unstable periods.\nWhy transparency is key for indie hackers starting out\nHere's my advice: Don’t be afraid to be open.\nTransparency is rare, but it’s also what attracts people. Be honest with your users, your team, and the people around you. Long-term trust matters more than short-term optics.\nAnd don’t be afraid to make mistakes.\nThe more approaches you try, the higher your chances of success. Mistakes are unavoidable — I still make them regularly. What matters is learning from them and adjusting, not avoiding failure at all costs.\nWhat's next?\nI’m currently focused on:\nScaling my core apps (subscriptions, MRR growth)\nTesting new directions and product ideas\nExperimenting with ASO, pricing, and distribution\nMy long-term goal is to build a diversified business.\nI don’t want to rely on a single platform. That means spreading risk across the App Store, Google Play, and SaaS. On the web side, I’ve already run two test launches. One of them proved to be the wrong direction, and I will shut it down in February. The other is gradually gaining traction — a link-in-bio and website builder called\nType.link\n.\nOver time, my apps will become platform-agnostic and available across all major platforms, including the web. That way, they can grow — independent of any single ecosystem.\nYou can follow along while I build in public on\nTwitter\n— I share my journey, experiments, lessons, and behind-the-scenes insights daily.",

    "title": "From open-source donations to $13k MRR product",
    "description": "Andris Reinman built a well-known open-source product. Then, he built a new product, monetized it, and grew it to $13k MRR. Here's how.",
    "content": "Companies\nEmailEngine, Nodemailer\nFounder\nAndris Reinman\nRevenue\n$13K a month\nAndris Reinman is the creator of\nNodemailer\n, an open-source project used by hundreds of thousands of developers. But it didn't pay the bills. So he launched related open-source product —\nEmailEngine —\nand transitioned it into a $13k MRR business.\nHere's Andris on how he did it.\n👇\nFrom open source to SaaS(ish)\nI’m an email software developer and open-source maintainer. I’m best known for my open-source work — most notably\nNodemailer\n, which is used by hundreds of thousands of developers and companies worldwide.\nWhile open source brings a lot of visibility and impact, it doesn’t really pay the bills. I do receive regular donations, but they’re in the low hundreds per month.\nAbout five years ago, I decided to turn my experience in email infrastructure into a business and started a company that builds and sells email software.\nThe original plan was to build multiple products, but in practice, one clearly stood out. Since then, I’ve been focused almost exclusively on\nEmailEngine\n— a self-hosted application that lets developers access email accounts via a simple HTTP REST API instead of dealing directly with IMAP, SMTP, or vendor-specific APIs like Microsoft Graph or Gmail.\nWe're currently at $13k MRR, growing at roughly 20% per year. Revenue growth has been slow but steady, so the revenue chart has no sudden bumps or exponential curves — just a mostly linear line from zero to its current position.\nBurning out and starting up calmly\nI was the CTO of a small VC-funded startup for four years. I took my laptop to the toilet and put it under my pillow while sleeping, just in case something happened and required a fast reaction. After four years, I was burnt out. I wanted a break.\nAs a long-time developer, taking a break still meant working — just without the pressure. That mindset shaped many of my decisions later. It’s also why I don’t provide managed hosting or take on large customers. If someone contacts me asking for a demo or wants to negotiate with “my sales team,” I kindly point them to some of my competitors instead.\nAll my customers are self-serve — usually competent, small technical teams that don’t require hand holding and therefore don’t burden me with constant support requests. What was originally meant to be a short break until I ran out of cash reserves turned out to be a viable business. I’ve been doing it ever since.\nAn unusual tech stack\nEmailEngine\nis built on Node.js and uses Redis as its database. The homepage is hosted on\numso.com\n, and the documentation is a Docusaurus project hosted on GitHub Pages. I also use Claude Code a lot these days.\nUsing Redis as the main database is not a very common choice — Redis is usually seen as a caching layer rather than an actual database. In my case, Redis was the option that had the best compatibility with IMAP indexing, specifically because of its Sorted Set data structure. Without going too deep into the details, that was the deciding factor.\nI also didn’t want to ask users to set up multiple databases for different purposes, so I decided to use Redis for everything. It’s a choice I’ve sometimes regretted. Redis is missing a lot of features you’d normally expect from a database, like proper querying, and that has meant spending time implementing workarounds I wouldn’t have needed with a more traditional DB.\nThat said, keeping things simple has helped overall. It’s much easier for users to spin up their first trial instance for testing, and once someone is already testing the product, they’re much more likely to start paying.\nTechnical challenges\nEmailEngine\nis technically a complex piece of software, and the main challenge has been that every customer uses it slightly differently and against different email backends. Even though email protocols have been standards for a long time, there are still noticeable differences between providers. What works one way with a Gmail account might behave differently with, for example, Korean Naver mail hosting.\nThese issues are hard to plan for in advance. If I don’t have an account with a specific email provider, there’s no real way to test it. Getting access to such accounts can be expensive if the provider is commercial, or outright impossible in some cases — especially with regional providers that require a local mobile number for account verification.\nFinding the model\nEmailEngine\nstarted out as yet another open-source side project, so for the first two years, I worked on it in my free time while still at my previous job. Initially, I didn’t intend it to become an actual business. The idea was to use it to increase the donations I was getting for supporting my open-source software development.\nThat didn’t really work, so I tried a dual-licensing approach. The open-source version was licensed under AGPL, and for “serious businesses” I offered an MIT-licensed version for a small yearly fee. There were almost no takers for that either. This phase took about a year and a half.\nEventually, I decided to go fully commercial, and almost immediately started gaining customers — mostly previous users of the free project, but also companies that wanted continued updates and upgrades.\nSo now, it is self-hosted software that requires a paid subscription to operate. Without a subscription, it runs in a 14-day free trial mode, after which it stops working. Subscriptions are yearly and self-renewing, and I use Stripe for subscription management. There is only a single subscription plan. There are no upsells or tiers — everyone gets exactly the same product, whether they’re a solo developer or a large bank.\nSince there’s no hosted or managed version, I don’t really consider it SaaS — more like on-prem software with a subscription model.\nAfter monetizing it, it remained a side project that I worked on during evenings and weekends. But I was already burned out from my day job. I started the process of exiting that role, which, for various reasons, took about half a year, until I was finally able to go all in.\nAt that point,\nEmailEngine\nwas still not making enough to support me financially — around $500 MRR. I was living off my previous cash reserves, but I could see the potential and, more importantly, I actually wanted to work on this project. So I went all in and started working on it full-time.\nGrowth via open source projects\nThe biggest obstacle was reaching a point where the revenue was high enough for me to start paying myself, so the project no longer felt like a temporary pet project. But it wasn’t something I had to actively “overcome” in a deliberate way. At first, the revenue simply wasn’t enough. Over time, it became enough.\nI didn’t push for growth. I just kept developing the product, saw that there was steady growth, and assumed that eventually it would get there — and it did.\nThe first ~10 subscribers were all users of\nEmailEngine\nback when it was still an open-source project. At the time, it had a different name - IMAP API. IMAP API was fairly popular, with around 1,000 stars on GitHub.\nOtherwise, I’ve used a single growth “strategy” from the beginning. I’d call it engineering-led marketing. I’ve released a number of popular open-source and free products, and linked from those to\nEmailEngine\n.\nSince all of these projects are email-related, there’s a natural overlap. For example, a Nodemailer user might eventually need features that Nodemailer doesn’t provide, but\nEmailEngine\ndoes — such as Microsoft Graph API–based sending using OAuth2. In those cases, they may end up checking out\nEmailEngine\n, and in rare cases, they end up paying for it.\nI’ve never done paid ads — my marketing budget has always been $0.\nThe only other approach worth mentioning has been SEO. In particular, the “EmailEngine vs.\nsome major alternative\n” type of articles. Users of those alternative providers who aren’t happy with their service go looking for options, find\nEmailEngine\n, and some of them turn into customers.\nThat said, it likely works both ways. I don’t really know whether I’ve gained more customers than I’ve lost to competitors through this, but overall it seems to have worked well enough.\nThe advantage of experience\nMy background in building open-source email projects has been a big advantage. Over the years—Nodemailer is 15 years old by now—I’ve gained fairly rare experience in a topic that is both complex and boring for most people. Along the way, I’ve also built an audience of developers who already use my projects.\nLabeling\nEmailEngine\nas “made by the creator of Nodemailer” definitely makes it more trustworthy. Nodemailer has been around “forever” and quietly does its thing, so people tend to assume\nEmailEngine\nwill probably do the same.\nLook for your edge\nHere's my advice: Look for an edge you might have — one that either you haven't noticed yet or you don't think of as an edge.\nFor example, I never considered my open-source work to be a growth driver for a business. It only turned into one after I had already started.\nWhat's next?\nI plan to keep building\nEmailEngine\n, and maybe return to my original idea of building multiple related projects. I’ve had many ideas over the years, but haven’t had the time —\nEmailEngine\nhas been large enough to require my full attention.\nNow, with AI, software development has become much faster, so I might revisit some of those old ideas. For example, a purely email-sending–oriented solution that would be much more scalable than\nEmailEngine\n— essentially providing the same email-sending capabilities, but in a more scalable way.\nEmailEngine\nis tightly coupled to individual email accounts, and since each account requires constant attention — polling for new messages or accessing the mailbox — it consumes a lot of system resources. There’s also no horizontal scaling, which makes it difficult to build large-scale sending solutions on top of it.\nAs far as revenue, I have no plans to increase it beyond its current trajectory. As a solo business with essentially no cost base, and living in Eastern Europe, I’m quite happy with the current state.\nYou can follow along on\nLinkedIn\n. Here's the EmailEngine\nlanding page\n,\ndocumentation\n, and\nsource code\n. Note: EmailEngine is not open source but source-available: anyone can inspect the full source code, but using it requires a valid subscription.",

I had a working product and payment from a customer right after launch.\nSince those early days,\nBlogMaker\nhas gone through hundreds of updates.\nI work with a highly customized forked version of CodeIgniter3 for the backend and jQuery for the front. It's my favorite combo for shipping fast. And I work with zero external libraries to reduce the overhead of constantly upgrading various dependencies.\nSince I run solo, I keep that to a minimum.\nSEO and partnerships\nOne of the biggest challenges I faced was unlocking a distribution channel that consistently delivered. I haven't completely overcome that challenge.\nInitially, I told everyone I knew in all my circles: Twitter, Slack, even offline meetups.\nI'm still super active on Twitter, but it doesn't bring in new customers. I mostly share lessons and my journey with my online friends. My user base doesn't overlap much.\nThese days, I focus on SEO and AEO because they are the most viable intent-based approaches to growth.\nSEO initially feels like a slog, but it's amazing how quickly you can rank with even short articles that answer a simple question — a strategy AI also relies on.\nSo, I run two blogs.\nOne\ncovers feature updates and product news.\nThe other\nis about SEO strategy, and it's where I publish \"vs\" and \"alternative to\" posts, as well as \"how-to\" articles based on questions people search for.\nOther than that, I produce videos about the product, new features, demos, and other content that resonates with my target audience. I also update the guide, change website copy, build relationships and partnerships, and sometimes do cold outreach.\nA good example is a recent partnership with\nRightBlogger.com\n, which directly integrates with\nBlogMaker\nand helps customers write highly comprehensive SEO articles with AI.\nIterating on pricing\nInitially,\nBlogMaker\noffered only yearly prices; while good for clients, this made building a sustainable business difficult. I transitioned to monthly pricing, but that proved challenging because the brand was previously positioned and consistently marketed with yearly pricing. Consequently, signups expected yearly pricing and did not convert.\nHowever, recently, monthly recurring revenue (MRR) has almost overtaken all previous MRR from yearly subscriptions, proving again that a monthly subscription model offers a sustainable approach for a growing business.\nIncreasing prices also had a positive impact on revenue, but I never increased prices for existing clients. Instead, I offered them a way to\ngracefully upgrade\nto newer plans and features.\nSelf care is crucial when indie hacking\nIn this journey, I've realized that taking care of myself is paramount to my product's success.\nWhen I started building SaaS products, I would go days without much physical activity because building and growing a product would suck me in. But that quickly backfired and eventually led me to a burnout circa 2020, which was not fun to experience.\nNow, I try to balance myself, even though I can still outwork anyone on the planet!\nThat means I try to get 7K steps per day. I also go to the gym at least four times a week to lift weights. Whenever I feel off, lifting weights is my escape.\nI also meditate. It helps me become more patient and focused. It also helps better observe myself and detach from my thoughts, which often stem from my environment, upbringing, etc. Distinguishing between beneficial and detrimental thoughts has been a game changer.\nThe right way to find PMF\nI see a ton of early-stage indie hackers focusing on the product first. This is highly risky because you don't know if many people experience the problem you're trying to solve regularly.\nWhile \"scratching your own itch\" can be a good approach, it requires significant luck to succeed; many other people must share your specific need.\nI now highly recommend looking for what people buy (the product), what types of customers buy it (potentially business people), and how they find the product (channels and distribution).\nOther criteria include why you are the right person to build such a thing (and if not, how you can become that person), and your unfair go-to-market advantage.\nWhat's next?\nMy immediate goals for\nBlogMaker\nare to grow it to a 5-figure MRR business with at least 80% in profits. Long-term, I plan to continue iterating based on the latest technologies and customer requirements.\nThe world of SEO, now with AI, is moving fast, and I want\nBlogMaker\nto be at the front of it all.\nI also recently started another product,\nAMSDeck.com\n, geared towards bigger organizations. This product came from extensive research, based on Rob Walling's teachings, particularly his most recent course, which I highly recommend:\nThe SaaS Launchpad\n. You cannot skim this course; it demands dedication and offers significant rewards.\nYou can follow along on my\npodcast\nand I occasionally blog at\nvalsopi.com\n. The holding company of one that produced\nBlogMaker\n,\nAMSDeck\n, and other products is\nHandmade Spaceships, Inc.",

    "content": "Companies\nIACrea, Feedbask, Subclip, Refindie\nFounder\nPauline Clavelloux\nRevenue\n>$8.3K a month\nPauline Clavelloux always wanted to build a business, but she couldn't quite get herself to start. Then, after nearly ten years at IBM, she took the leap.\nShe had a few failures and an exit, and she now has a portfolio of SaaS products bringing in over $100k ARR.\nHere's Pauline on how she did it.\n👇\nFailures and exits\nI’m Pauline Clavelloux, a French tech entrepreneur. I worked for 9.5 years at IBM before becoming a full-time indie hacker.\nI started indie hacking during COVID and built several SaaS products from scratch; some failed, one sold, and four others serve clients:\nIACrea\n, an AI-powered real estate marketing suite that transforms property photos into virtually staged images, videos, and ready-to-post social media content.\nFeedbask\n, a customer feedback and support widget with different actionable modules (live chat, feedback collection, bug reports, feature requests ...) directly inside their app.\nSubclip\n, a web app that automatically adds subtitles to videos, translates and dubs into other languages, etc.\nRefindie\n, an affiliate management tool for SaaS creators without upfront cost.\nI reached €100K+ ARR back in 2024, and revenue increased in 2025.\nThe first taste of indie hacking\nI’ve always wanted to start a business, ever since I was a kid.\nI constantly had new ideas, but before COVID, I never started anything. The main reason was fear: I didn’t know where to start, and the administrative side of running a business felt overwhelming.\nDuring COVID, I saw some friends launching their own online projects. They already knew how to handle the business setup, and that gave me the push I needed. I teamed up with a friend and built my first product: a crypto trading bot. It was a complete business failure... but also a personal success, because it worked and traded automatically for me!\nI eventually stopped it, but that experience changed everything.\nI realized how much I love building things, working for myself, and having the freedom to work from anywhere. That sense of independence is something I never felt while working a 9-to-5 job. I love working from home.\nA lean mindset\nWhen I built my first real product, I had a technical background in web development, but I learned how to run a business through experience.\nThe first versions of my SaaS products were extremely simple. I didn’t focus on design or scalability; I just wanted to see if people would use it.\nFor IACrea, for instance, the very first version only supported uploading one photo at a time and returning one AI-generated image. But it was enough to get the first paying users.\nI keep my process lean:\nBuild fast, even if it’s ugly.\nLaunch early, get feedback.\nImprove only what matters.\nQuit if no traction.\nThat mindset helped me ship multiple products quickly. Each one taught me something new about tech, about users, and about what drives revenue.\nA simple stack for every project\nMy tech stack is quite simple:\nFrontend + Backend:\nNext.js + Tailwind CSS\nAuth + Database + Storage:\nSupabase\nPayments:\nStripe mainly, and Polar for\nSubclip\nHosting:\nVercel & AWSGrowing four products\nBuilding is easy, distribution is hard\nBuilding the product was the easy part; making people aware of its existence was hard.\nI tested many approaches: social media, video content, SEO, physical events, direct conversations with users... and over time, I learned that distribution is key.\nFor IACrea, we initially grew by staying close to the market: Facebook groups, in-person networking events, and partnerships with industry players. Direct conversations and trust were crucial early on.\nFor Feedbask, Refindie, and Subclip, we have mostly driven growth through social media. Regularly posting about the product, sharing real use cases, and building in public helped attract early users who understood the value.\nOverall, adapting the distribution strategy to each product and audience made the biggest difference. Each channel compounds differently over time, and what works for a SaaS might not work for another SaaS.\nI'll also say that building in public is extremely helpful. Sharing what I’m working on, what’s not working, and why lets me get early feedback and stay close to real user needs.\nSolve your own problems\nStart by solving a real problem you personally experience; it makes the problem clearer and the motivation stronger.\nFor example, customers kept asking the same questions, and answering them manually was time-consuming and unproductive. Frustration led me to build Feedbask: a centralized inbox accessible to the whole team that included context. Soon, it will also pre-fill replies based on past conversations to avoid rewriting the same answers repeatedly. Can't wait for that!\nTurning internal pain points into a product was a huge advantage. When you build something you personally need, you know what's needed, and what's not working well with other solutions. And if you fail to monetize it, at least it's useful to you!\nParting advice\nHere's my advice:\nDon’t wait to be “ready” or to get the perfect product to share your work.\nBuild in public early, talk to users as soon as possible, and let feedback guide the product. People especially love to see the journey and your product evolve.\nSystematize repetitive tasks instead of handling them manually.\nFocus on learning fast rather than trying to get everything perfect.\nBe resilient, and be prepared to fail. Founders who are successful on their first attempt are VERY rare. You see many successful people online, but usually, it took them a few years to get revenue.\nWhat's next?\nMy main goal is to keep building useful, simple products that solve real problems for the real estate area and business owners, the two audiences I can reach. I want to grow all my SaaS sustainably to at least $30k MRR each.\nAnd I want to continue sharing my journey openly, building in public, and showing that you don’t need a huge team or massive funding to build profitable, meaningful products.\nLastly, I recently started creating videos (find my YouTube profile\nhere\n) and I'd like to growth that channel\nYou can follow along on my\nnewsletter\nand on social media:\nX profile\n,\nYouTube\n, and\nLinkedIn\n. And here's my\nportfolio\n.",

    "description": "After a successful exit, Romàn Czerny built a tool using the growth tactic that had led to his success. Now, it's bringing in $27k MRR. Here's how.",
    "content": "Company\nGojiberry AI\nFounder\nRomàn Czerny\nRevenue\n$27K a month\nAfter Romàn Czerny's first business got acquired for seven figures, he decided to build a new business around the growth tactic that was responsible for that success.\nHe started by doing it manually for clients, then created a product to automate the process. Now,\nGojiberry AI\nis at $27k MRR.\nHere's Romàn on how he's doing it.\n👇\nA 7-figure exit\nMy name is Román. I’m 30 years old, I'm currently based in Lisbon, Portugal, I have a weakness for pastéis de nata, and I’m the cofounder of\nGojiberry AI\n.\nI started doing online business in 2019, first as a freelancer, then through affiliate marketing. In 2023, I discovered a passion for SaaS, leading me to build my first product, CocoAI, which I later sold for seven figures.\nToday, I’m working on\nGojiberry AI\n, an intent-based LinkedIn outreach tool. It helps B2B companies find and convert customers on LinkedIn by leveraging buying signals and reaching prospects when they’re ready to engage. We reached $27k MRR at the beginning of December, and we made $35,000 in sales the same month.\nScratching his own itch\nOur previous SaaS sold WhatsApp solutions for e-commerce. We saw that e-commerce founders actively engaging on LinkedIn, especially around topics like email marketing for e-commerce, converted significantly better.\nSo we started doing it manually. We searched for e-commerce founders interacting with specific keywords and topics. It worked extremely well, but it was incredibly time-consuming.\nAfter selling that SaaS, we asked a simple question: Why not turn the system that helped us sell our previous SaaS for seven figures into a product?\nThat is how\nGojiberry AI\nwas born, built on the same approach that powered CocoAI's growth and exit.\nValidation through manual services\nTo build the MVP, we did not write a single line of product code. Instead, we first focused on getting customers. We told them we would deliver high-intent leads, and then we manually searched for those leads on their behalf.\nFinding 100 qualified prospects often took several hours, sometimes up to five. We spent an entire summer doing this manually, with the help of multiple virtual assistants based in Pakistan and India. It was painful and completely unscalable. But it proved two important things: Real demand existed and customers were genuinely happy with the results.\nThat validation pushed us to turn the process into an actual product with\nGojiberry AI\n.\nThat wasn't easy. We had to automate a very human, intuitive process. Identifying real buying signals on LinkedIn is not just about scraping data. It requires context, judgment, and timing. Translating this into a reliable system without losing quality took time and many iterations.\nTech stack\nI’m not technical at all; my CTO handles all the technical stuff. But we use:\nAWS\nFramer\nFirebase\nGemini\nClaude\nChatGPT\nGrowth and consistency\nOur growth strategy was multi-dimensional:\nReddit:\nWe built early trust by sharing real data and transparent results in SaaS communities.\nLinkedIn:\nWe ran a dual engine, viral inbound content combined with high-intent outbound campaigns using our own tool.\nCold Email:\nWe scaled volume, sending thousands of emails daily using leads sourced from Sales Navigator and\nGojiberry AI\n.\nInfluencers:\nWe partnered with trusted B2B voices to borrow credibility and reach high-quality users.\nOther tactics:\nWe layered the above with YouTube tutorials, newsletter sponsorships, webinars, and building in public on X.\nNo single channel was a silver bullet, but we found working with B2B influencers on LinkedIn particularly helpful.\nOur core customers already spend time on LinkedIn, so partnering with influencers who speak directly to that audience gave us instant credibility and distribution. It allowed us to reach the right people, in the right context, with a message they already trusted.\nAnd overall, the real secret was the compounding effect of showing up everywhere, every single day.\nExpansion revenue\nOur business model is subscription-based SaaS. We sell\nGojiberry AI\non monthly and annual plans. As teams grow and rely more on intent-based outreach, they naturally upgrade their plans, which creates built-in expansion revenue.\nFrom the beginning, we made sure customers could see results quickly, meaning qualified conversations and booked meetings, not just data or dashboards. That made it easier to convert trials, reduce friction in sales, and drive word of mouth.\nNarrow down your ICP\nHere's my advice: Pick one clear ICP and one clear use case. Trying to serve everyone slows everything down. A narrow focus makes product decisions, messaging, and growth much easier.\nInitially, we tried to serve too many profiles at once. Once we focused on the users who truly valued intent-based outreach, everything became easier. If I had to start over, I would validate pricing and positioning earlier and narrow the ICP faster.\nAlso, try all marketing channels. There is never enough marketing!\nWhat's next?\nOur main goal is to make intent-based outreach the default way B2B teams generate pipeline.\nOn the product side, we want\nGojiberry AI\nto become the standard system for detecting real buying signals and turning them into qualified conversations across LinkedIn and other channels.\nThat means deepening signal quality, automation, and integrations, while keeping the experience simple and outcome-driven.\nYou can visit\ngojiberry.ai\nand start a free trial. If you want 14 days instead of 7, send us the word INDIE14 in the in-app chat and we’ll extend your trial.\nAnd you can follow me on\nX\nand\nLinkedIn\n.",

    "description": "Ruben Gamez found a gap in a crowded market and filled it. Then, he harnessed indirect distribution to grow to an ARR of several million. Here's how.",
    "content": "Company\nSignWell\nFounder\nRuben Gamez\nRevenue\n>$83K a month\nWhile growing his first product, Ruben Gamez, saw a gap in the e-signature market. After lots of market research, he identified a way forward, built a simple MVP, tested it with customers of that first product, and then expanded into the gap.\nNow,\nSignWell\nis bringing in several million in ARR.\nHere's Ruben on how he gained a strong foothold in a crowded market.\n👇\nThe early days\nI’m the founder of\nSignWell\n, an easy-to-use electronic signature app that helps thousands of people get their documents signed legally and securely. We generate several million in ARR, have tens of thousands of paying customers, and are growing fast. We have processed over ten million signed documents, both through one-off sending and automated API workflows like SaaS companies embedding e-signature functionality into their platforms and products.\nI got started in tech later than many other founders. I didn’t have a computer until my 20s. I didn’t even know how to turn on a computer. I learned to program before I owned a computer by reading a book on C++ and writing code with paper and pencil.\nOnce I got my first office job — tech support for Compaq computers — I met someone at work who told me they had their own website. I was blown away and asked him how he did it. He showed me a website called\nwebmonkey.com\nthat had a bunch of web development tutorials. I went through those tutorials and taught myself web development, design, and even some animation — shout out and RIP ActionScript/Shockwave.\nEventually, I hustled to get a job as a ColdFusion developer at a large payroll company. This was my first real dev job. Here, I learned other web development languages (ASP classic, Java, Python, Ruby, etc.), UX, SEO, and a lot more.\nSeveral years later, I decided to launch and bootstrap my first startup, and now I’m on my second one with\nSignWell\n.\nStarting with market research\nThe idea for\nSignWell\ncame from customers of my first SaaS, Bidsketch. Thousands of paying Bidsketch customers asked for better e-signature options than our integrations offered, prompting my initial market research.\nI tested the market to see if demand existed beyond what Bidsketch customers showed. Many complaints highlighted the expense and difficulty of existing e-signature tools, so I saw a product opportunity to create something with modern, intuitive UX, that was more affordable, and highly secure and compliant.\nAnd a couple of interesting distribution opportunities were unexplored, so I saw a path to acquiring customers. The e-signature market is crowded with many options. Part of the puzzle in markets like this is cutting through the noise and reaching the right people—customers and partners.\nA wildly basic MVP\nThe first version was interesting because it was very basic compared to our current product. Users could upload and sign documents, so it performed the core function, but we lacked several features one would consider essential for launch.\nFor example:\nAudit trail\nTemplate links\nAPI\nSOC 2/HIPAA\nLooking back, it's wild to think we launched without something as core as an audit trail. Early on, we manually generated audit trail reports on demand, which was enough for customers while we properly built the automated version.\nWe now have all of this (and more), but none of it existed back then.\nCurrently, we’re using React, Rails, Redis, Sidekiq, and PostgreSQL, and we run everything on AWS. For SOC 2 and HIPAA, we use Vanta, which cuts down on some of the work, but managing that still involves a fair amount of overhead since we’re SOC 2 Type II in three categories — not just one, as companies typically do.\nA tough market\nWhen I first started considering building an e-signature product, I talked to other founders and marketers who previously built in the same market. Some exited successfully, while many others did not. They all said the same thing: \"Don’t do it.\"\nObviously, I still did it, but now I understand what they meant. The market is difficult. In a mature and crowded market, you can’t just build another e-sign product and expect fast growth and customers. You need both distribution and a unique product angle.\nFiguring out how and where to compete took a lot of work. While Bidsketch customers were a good starting point for early feedback, I needed to find people who already paid for e-signature products and weren’t happy.\nTo learn from customers of my competitors, I ran ads on Twitter, targeting competitor audiences and offered an Amazon gift card for a 10-minute call about their experience with the specific competitor they used. I also created an early access homepage that redirected sign-ups to a survey asking about their experience with existing tools, then redirected them back to a confirmation page for early access.\nOur product differentiation is enterprise-grade features and compliance at an affordable price, with a nice UX and developer experience for the API. It took several years and a lot of grinding to get here. From an opportunity-cost perspective, easier markets exist. But today, we’ve built a brand people like and have significant market traction.\nAvoiding aggressive pricing tactics\nWe’re one of the few e-signature products that still offer unlimited documents. All older, bigger brands did this originally, but they moved away from this model and adopted aggressive pricing tactics, locking you into long-term contracts.\nWe offer free documents with our e-sign API, but for higher-volume use, we charge a low per-document fee. We’re typically 5x more affordable than competitors on this front.\nThat said, you can’t be more affordable and expect to win in a market like this. None of that would mean anything if we didn’t have an extremely high bar for security and compliance. We handle a lot of sensitive data, so it’s a must for many of our larger customers. And many cheaper competitors can’t or won’t do this.\nThis isn’t an easy combination to achieve, but it has helped us gain good traction and grow revenue.\nIndirect distribution\nAs far as growth, every stage has been different.\nGoing from 0 to 1 and getting those early customers involved finding traffic and leads any way I could. I initially experimented with indirect distribution and ads (Google/Facebook).\nIndirect distribution was the most helpful strategy. To acquire customers, everyone targets the most obvious leads, like people searching for e-signature products. But I’ve found success in crowded markets by targeting related solutions that lead to my product, which competitors ignore.\nFor example, when I got into the market, I grew traffic to over 100k monthly visitors by creating free contract templates. This is indirect because we don't create contracts; we help sign them. But I knew that people who download contracts would then need to sign them.\nNo one in our market was active in this space at the time, so it was a good opportunity to offer something free to potential customers.\nBack then, I also created a Google Sheet listing our “Dream 100” places to get mentioned and partner with. This is a strategy from the book, “The Ultimate Sales Machine.” You create a dream list of important partners or customers, brainstorm an angle for each, and contact them personally, one at a time. Relentless follow-up is part of the mix.\nMore recently, it’s involved a mix of many different things, from sponsorships and partnerships to integrations and building features to bring on larger teams and enterprise customers.\nLearn from people in your market\nHere's my advice: Learn more aggressively from people already in the market. Everyone does this to some extent, but most people can go much further.\nFor example, I found e-signature startup founders and marketers, and learned from them. I didn’t know any of these people when I started. I found some by listing launched products in the space, checking their status, and then using LinkedIn to contact former employees.\nI also spoke with at least ten sales reps from e-signature startups. I even had weekly and monthly consulting calls with one of them; he shared how he sold into the market and discussed specific scenarios I faced.\nBeyond that, it's crucial to become good at doing uncomfortable things. You'll most often find the most growth — both personal and business — by doing things that initially feel unnatural or uncomfortable. Eventually, it gets easier if you keep going, and the payoff is well worth it.\nWhat's next?\nOn the business side, I want to deliver a great product, grow an amazing team that serves a market largely abandoned by established brands, and build a great brand.\nOn the personal side, I’m entirely focused on my family and on raising our two kids to be healthy and happy.\nYou can follow along on my\nX\n. And check out\nSignWell\n!",
