Supports filtering by genre, NSFW content, and specific story details, and separates models into brainstorming, memory, and writing categories.|\n|Lechmazur Creative Writing Benchmark|Measures how well models weave 10 key story elements (characters, objects, motivations, etc.) into short stories using multiple judges and transparent scoring, though judges may favor safer writing.|\n|EQ-Bench Creative Writing v3|Uses challenging creative prompts to test humor, romance, and unconventional writing, with metrics like “Slop” scores for clichés and repetition detection; penalizes NSFW and darker content.|\n|NC-Bench (Novelcrafter)|Evaluates practical writing tasks such as rewriting, idea generation, summarization, and translation, focusing on how useful models are for writers rather than full story generation.|\n|WritingBench|Tests models across many writing styles (creative, persuasive, technical, etc.) using 1,000+ real-world examples, offering broad coverage but relying heavily on the critic model.|\n|Fiction Live Benchmark|Assesses whether models can understand and remember very long stories by quizzing them on plot details and character arcs, without measuring prose quality.|\n|UGI Writing Leaderboard|Combines multiple writing metrics into a single score with breakdowns for repetition, length control, and readability, enabling quick comparisons while hiding some tradeoffs.|",

      "selftext": "I like to read &amp; write fiction in my spare time and keep seeing posts asking which LLM works best for creative writing. As a result, I put together a list of the benchmarks I’ve come across so far, hope it helps someone out!\n\nOn a side note, I’m insanely biased toward Kimi K2 😄\n\n|Benchmark|Description|\n|:-|:-|\n|Narrator.sh|A site where AI models write and publish stories ranked by real reader metrics like views and ratings. Supports filtering by genre, NSFW content, and specific story details, and separates models into brainstorming, memory, and writing categories.|\n|Lechmazur Creative Writing Benchmark|Measures how well models weave 10 key story elements (characters, objects, motivations, etc.) into short stories using multiple judges and transparent scoring, though judges may favor safer writing.|\n|EQ-Bench Creative Writing v3|Uses challenging creative prompts to test humor, romance, and unconventional writing, with metrics like “Slop” scores for clichés and repetition detection; penalizes NSFW and darker content.|\n|NC-Bench (Novelcrafter)|Evaluates practical writing tasks such as rewriting, idea generation, summarization, and translation, focusing on how useful models are for writers rather than full story generation.|\n|WritingBench|Tests models across many writing styles (creative, persuasive, technical, etc.) using 1,000+ real-world examples, offering broad coverage but relying heavily on the critic model.|\n|Fiction Live Benchmark|Assesses whether models can understand and remember very long stories by quizzing them on plot details and character arcs, without measuring prose quality.|\n|UGI Writing Leaderboard|Combines multiple writing metrics into a single score with breakdowns for repetition, length control, and readability, enabling quick comparisons while hiding some tradeoffs.|",
